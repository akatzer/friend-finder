Friend Finder Application

Overview: Friend Finder is a compatibility based matching application. The user enters their name and a URL that links to a photo of themself. They are then asked 10 questions about their personality. Once those are entered and the submit button has been clicked a modal will pop-up and tell them who their closest match is. This match is determined by comparing the user entered scores from the personality test to the scores of every other person in the database. The match is made based on the lowest difference in scores. When the modal is closed the application restarts.
